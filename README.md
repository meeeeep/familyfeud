# Family-Feud-Game



The purpose of this game was to create a 2 player game that kept score and allowed players to submit answers and check it on the board if it was correct. I used Jquery, Java Script, CSS, and HTML. I was able to make it into a 2 player game but ran out of time to make player 2 able to submit questions and keep score. I also was able to have the answers and questions as well as the name entered by each player to appear on the screen but I was unable due to time to create a function to get the player to the next question once they answered the question correctly. I was also unable due to time to create a incorrect function and a reset function like I had planned. I will continue to work on this projec and make updates. Below is a link to what I currently have.Also listed is a link to my Trello Board. I made 2 Trello boards, 1 for creating the game and the other with the user stories.
